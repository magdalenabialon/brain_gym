## Question One
You stand at a fork in the road. Next to each of the two forks, there stands a guard. You know the following things: First that one path leads to paradise, the other leads to Death. You cannot distinguish between the two paths. You also know that one of the two guards always tells the truth and the other always lies. You have permission to ask one guard one question to discover which path leads to paradise. What one question would you ask to guarantee you take the path to paradise?

- You could also ask **"Does the guard to paradise lie?"**
- If the guard to paradise is a liar he will say "no" (which is a lie because he does lie).
- If the guard to paradise tells the truth he will say "no" (which is the truth).
- In which case the guard to death says "yes." (If he is a liar he will say the truth teller lies, and if he tells the truth he will say the liar is a liar).
- This means in either situation if the guard says no, take his path. But if the guard says yes, take the other path.
